This is the code repository for [MATLAB App Designing: The ultimate Guide for MATLAB Apps [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/matlab-app-designing-ultimate-guide-matlab-apps-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The First segment of the course is on creating apps in MATLAB using its graphical user interface utility called GUIDE. The GUIDE provides essential graphical components for converting your code into a meaningful software. The graphical components include radio buttons, tables, check boxes, sliders and many others. The main motivation for adding this segment is the observation that students and people put a lot of effort in writing the code but little on its appearance. By completing this segment of creating apps in GUIDE, you will easily transform your code into a well understood piece of software that the users will find useful to interact with. The segment contains 2+ hours of recorded lectures. Every lecture contains a demonstration of the concepts and the codes are included with the course. The following is the outline of the course Segment 1: Basics of the GUIDE Segment 2: Linking the Code with GUISegment 3: Advance Techniques for GUIDESegment 4: Sample Projects with GUIDESegment 5: More Useful Tricks and Examples with GUIDE.
